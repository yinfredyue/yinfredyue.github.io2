Problem: 
- [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/)
- [H-Index II](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index-ii/)


The definition

> A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

implies that `h >= 0` and `n-h >= 0`, so `0 <= h <= n`. Thus, we only need to search in this range.

It's natural to sort the citations, and verify from 0 to n, if the current value can be a h-index.

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& C) {
        // h in [1, n]
        int res = 0;
        sort(C.begin(), C.end());
        for (int i = C.size()-1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int h = C.size()-i;
            if (C[i] >= h && (i-1 < 0 || C[i-1] <= h)) {
                res = h;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
};
```



This graph visualization is amazing.

We are trying to find the length of the maximum green square in the historgram. Actually, if the `citations` are sorted in ascending order, the graph looks like this:

H-Index II specifies that `citations` are sorted, and requires logrithmic time algorithm, so it strongly hints for binary search. 

In the picture above, h = 3, which is the target we are searching for. You should consider the case when you get 1 (you should set `left = mid+1`), 3 (you find the target), and 5 (you should update `right = mid-1`).

```c++
class Solution {
public:
    int hIndex(vector<int>& C) {
        int res = 0;
        int left = 0, right = C.size()-1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = (left + right) >> 1;
            
            int h = C.size()-mid;
            if (C[mid] >= h && (mid-1 < 0 || C[mid-1] <= h)) {
                return h;
            } else if (C[mid] < h) {
                left = mid+1;                
            } else {
                right = mid-1;
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
};
```

Also, there can be at most one h-index: the dashed line crosses the histogram once and at most once.

### Summary

The crucial step is to realize that `0 <= h <= n`, and use sorting.

H-Index II provides strong hint. The graph visualization is really helpful for analysis.
